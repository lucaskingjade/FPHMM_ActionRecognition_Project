In this directory, all the dataset files are about two activities(Simple Walk and Walk with smth in the Hands). But each file has a different missing pairs which is specified by the abbreviation in the file name, such as 'PfSW_NtWH' representing missing pairs are {Panic Fear,Simple Walk} and {Neutral Walk with smth in the Hands}. In addition, for do experiments of comparing the performance of CHMM and HMM under the case that small training set is given. We randomly choose 1 to 4th of the whole training expamles as some new and small subdatasets. But in these small datasets,the training expamples,validation expamples and missing expamples don't changed and are still the same with those in the large datasets.
