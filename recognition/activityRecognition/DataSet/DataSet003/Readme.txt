Datasets in this directory are similar to those in '../DataSet002' in the way of doing PCA. In these datasets, PCA is done for each activity, not for the whole training examples. The only difference is that these datasets aren't scaled, which is right for motion capture data, cause all the dimensions in the frame of a sequences are joint angles which have the same natural scale. If we still do scaling for such kind of data, we will break the scale that these dimension possesses in nature and we won't reduce the number of dimension to a small number. So this is maybe a little bit different from other tutorials about how to do PCA or how to process data out of here, but we are right. This DataSet should be delelted before the 5th May,2016 ,but we should keep this readme.txt or save this conlusion in this file to another documentation file.
